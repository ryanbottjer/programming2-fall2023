	<p>
		Harvey Ross Ball <i>(July 10, 1921 â€“ April 12, 2001)</i> was an American commercial artist. He is recognized as the designer of a popular smiley face graphic picture, which became an enduring and notable international icon. He never applied for a trademark for the iconic smiley image and only earned $45 for his efforts. Ball later founded the <b><i>World Smile Foundation</b></i> in 1999, a non-profit charitable trust that supports children's causes.
